\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

A switch with an eBPF virtual machine at its core was designed and implemented in hardware on the NetFPGA platform. 
This system allows executing parse, matching, and actions dynamically through eBPF instructions.
The system is protocol independent and, unlike the OpenFlow standard, allows to use new fields, facilitating the adoption of new protocols and services in computer networks.
EBPF instructions are generated from programs written in C or P4 language. 
The system allows changing the image of the eBPF program at runtime, allowing to modify how the flows should be processed with zero downtime.

For future work, it is desirable to place an eBPF processor for each input queue. Next step includes producing eBPFlow Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and commercializing it.
We envision that eBPF instructions will replace OpenFlow standard matching and eBPFlow will be used as smart NIC, switches, and routers.
